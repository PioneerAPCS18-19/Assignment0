For this assignment you will write a short Java program that will output
your initials. An example of mine is below.


        C C C C         J J J J J J J     K       K
      C         C             J           K     K
    C                         J           K   K
    C                         J           K K
    C                         J           K   K
      C         C       J     J           K     K
        C C C C          J J J            K       K


Use the System.out.println statement to output the letters.
